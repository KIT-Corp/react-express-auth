## 😞 The Problem

Even though we are a first world country, bringing in millions of dollars into our economy we still have major issues that have no solutions to them. Mental health issues, homelessness, and food insecurity. In New York City specifically, more than 1.4 million New Yorkers are experiencing food insecurity. Most of the data we have available needs to be gathered and put together, we want to give our communities as much control as we can when it comes to these issues because no one knows what we truly need but us.

## 🤔 Our Hypothesis

If time is money we can help people by collecting all this data in one spot and making it accessible for the community. We would also be able to have safe places for certain folks who find it hard to find these locations.

## 📱 Product Overview

Users will be able to create an account and search for food banks in their borough, using the most accurate and up-to-date data (as of April 2025). They can also leave reviews about their experiences—highlighting whether food banks offer additional services like afterschool programs, domestic violence resources, mental health support, or specific items such as baby food, clothing, and menstrual products.

## 🏙️ Mission Statement

Comen Todos comes from a Spanish phrase that goes, "A donde come uno, comen dos y a donde comen dos comen todos" which translates to "Where one eats, two eat and where two eat, everyone eats". This just highlights our core belief:

Everyone deserves a seat at the table.

During these tough economic times we know that about 50% of NYC households are struggling to make ends meet and this is affecting everyone from our elders to our youngest humans, 1 in every 4 children don't know where their next meal is coming from. Letting these insecurities grow harm all of us at the end of the day.

We created Comen Todos to help fight against the stigma of asking for help and to give the community a bit of power when it comes to fighting food insecurity. In these times where time is money, we hope to save folks some time and give them as much information we can all in one space. Our mission is simple:

We stand together, we help one another.
We eat together.

## 🫂 Who do we serve?

We are here for our community. We are here to uplift and offer a place where folks will be able to reach out for help.

## 🧗‍♂️ Key Technical Challenge

1. Implementing Leaflet map: For the frontend developer it was all new infornmation in how to get the data to render on the page and even how to get the map to render.

2. Using SHAD-CN: We had never used SHAD-CN but we were very excited to implement some of the aspects into our code.

## 🏋🏽 Extension Opportunities

1. Make the website have translation features:

- It will help make the website more accessible to other communities where English isn't folks first languages.

2. One-on-one chat feature:

- This will help users interact with one another and arrange meetings if folks have something another user needs.

3. Implement a directions feature:

- Users will be able to add their location and get up to date directions.
